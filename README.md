# Modern OBJ Loader

This project has two main goals:

- Learn to use cppfront in a real project
- Implement a new modern version of OBJ loader that using modern c++ features

> From Herb Sutter's [repository](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront):  
> "Cppfront is a compiler from an experimental C++ 'syntax 2' (Cpp2) to today's 'syntax 1' (Cpp1), to prove out some concepts, share some ideas, and prototype features that can also be proposed for evolving today's C++."
